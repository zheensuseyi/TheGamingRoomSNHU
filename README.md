# TheGamingRoomSNHU
// The Gaming Room was a client that made an android game "Draw it or Lose it" and wanted it ported over to other operating systems, my task was to make a software design document and outline the entire process. They mainly wanted to know what needed to be done and how much money and effort it would take in order to port the game over to other operating systems, consoles, and iPhone.
// What I did particulary well in developing this documentation was keeping it short and sweet without too much filler and going straight to the point. 
// The design document made it much easier to code because it was similar to writing pseudocode in that it gave me guidance and helped me visualize the code I was going to write.
// In all honestly I would probably revise the table containing all of the information about the various strengths and weaknesses of the various operating systems because I felt that I may not have gone in depth enough in that area. 
// By reading the guidelines carefully, I realized that The Gaming Room wanted to port over their game to every service possible and needed help deciding on which operating system to program the game and secure the servers with. I considered their needs and decided that Windows was best due to ease of use and the fact that accessing and using the cloud would be simple and secure.
// The way I approached designing this Software Design Document was slow and steady. I worked on it a little bit every day and made multiple revisions before finally submitting my final draft. In the future, I would definetly devote even more time and put a lot more effort into my next document.
